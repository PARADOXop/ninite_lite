# ninite_lite (Ninite-like Installer)
## This program allows you to install multiple software applications at once using their respective .exe files.

Instructions:
1. Prepare the .exe Files:
    - Create a folder containing all the .exe files of the software you wish to install.
2. Run Command Prompt as Administrator:
    - Open Command Prompt with administrator permissions.
3. Navigate to the Executable Directory:
    - Change directory to where the install.exe file is located:
    - code: cd path_to_install_exe_directory
4. Execute the Installer:
    - Run the install.exe file and provide the path to the folder containing the .exe files:
    - code: install.exe 'path_to_folder_with_exe_files'
    For example: code: install.exe ./downloads
